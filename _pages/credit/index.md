**Watery** is minimalist, bare-bones theme for Jekyll only using the Water.css framework while still following the best practices for accessibility and search-engine optimization, made by me!

**Features:**

- A fully customizable and empty `_BLANK_config.yml` to make getting up-and-running easy.
- Having a `_pages` collection for easier organization.
- Auto-generated links to newly created pages in the navigation.
- An author bio at the end of each post. (Located in `_inclues/author.html`)
- Full Rouge support for syntax highlighting. (Currently using `base16.solarized.light`)
- Auto-generated RSS feed, sitemap, accessibility features, and search-engine optimization.
