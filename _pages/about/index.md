### Purpose

Hi, I'm Brennan. I wrote two guests posts for Beeminder back in 2017-- [**Tao**](https://blog.beeminder.com/tao/) and [**Sting**](https://blog.beeminder.com/tao2/).

Although I felt as though they were good pieces of advice, I ultimately fell short and failed hard with Beeminder, and subsequently life. I wrote another long post reflecting on that [**here**](https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/goal-failure-bc3a39a0f418).

With that, I've decided to begin a meta-accountability experiement, where I'll report my progress with my goals on this website weekly, in collaboration with my account on Beeminder. I hope that this extra push of consistent reporting will help me succeed with my goals and stick to good habits.
