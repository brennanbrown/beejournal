<p class="site-intro">Hi, I'm Brennan. I created this website to provide weekly updates regarding my goals (systems) that I currently have on a website called <a href="http://beeminder.com/">Beeminder</a> as a way to keep myself accountable, as well as a place for general draft writing. For more information on the theory behind this idea, please check out the following links where I have written extensively about this: <a href=https://blog.beeminder.com/tao/>1</a>, <a href="https://blog.beeminder.com/tao2/">2</a>, <a href="https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/goal-failure-bc3a39a0f418">3</a>.</p>
