**Week Twenty-six!** Another uneventful week for myself. Initially I had a bit of hair-pulling trying to figure out deployment with Django, and luckily [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-django-with-postgres-nginx-and-gunicorn-on-ubuntu-18-04) has a great guide on just that. I really need to start revamping my website, but it's so fun to put that off and work on little projects instead. :P

One thing that I've been pondering is Beeminder's alerts. I've found that I derail way less if I have phone notifications turned on that remind me through the day to do what I said I was going to do. The way I have them set up right now is super unhelpful however, with 10 or so notifications buzzing (hah) my phone every few hours.

It's like a bombardment and kind of annoying. So, I suppose having a single alert would be really useful in contrast, but I don't really know which system to set the alert for. Because if I complete that one specifically early in the day, then I won't receive any alerts for other systems and will most likely derail.

Also, fellow Beeminder user @grayson made an informative thread on [skatesum goals](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/how-skatesum-works-was-when-does-a-skatesum-goal-update/7139), which is a very interesting albeit niche goal type. One place where I think it'd be perfect would be tracking sleep! Right now, I'm using a do-more goal, but enough oversleeping can also cause problems the way sleep deprivation can.

Anyways, there are a few systems I think I'm going to restart, like **/books**. I need to entirely re-think my approach to certain things that A) I'm still not doing well and B) I still want to be doing. The good news is that the majority of daily tasks that I used to think would be impossible to do _daily_ without much friction are happening on auto-pilot. It's just a matter of deconstructing what makes them work vs. what doesn't.
