**Week Sixty-four!** Well, it finally happened. The consequences of constantly edge-skating with beemergencies caught up to me. On Wednesday, I had a small emergency (everything is fine now) that caused me to miss a good portion of my daily routine, and caused a bunch of derailments because of that:

* **/obsidian** ($0)
* **/jobs** ($1)
* **/prayer** ($1)
* **/learning** ($0)
* **/writing** ($5)
* **/meditation** ($10)
* **/french** ($10)

I decided that it'd be much less of a hassle to just let them all go through and pay--it was a lot less money than I thought (less than $30 total), and I suppose that's because I rarely derail normally. (Any goal that's <$5 hasn't derailed once.) 

Now, you could make the argument that I'm not derailing *enough*, and that my goals are simply too easy to achieve, but there's a bout of suspicion on my end that that sort of philosophy is partially money-motivated for Beeminder itself. ðŸ¤”

Regardless, it did bring down my morale for quite a bit. I didn't bother going through each goal and ratcheting back to immediately start everything the next day. I instead let the default 7 days of respite go through and give myself a bit of an impromptu break. That was, though, a bad idea. As I've said before, inactivity begets inactivity, and I subsequently also derailed on **/github** and **/productivity**, yeesh.

But, I'm ratcheting everything tonight and starting my full daily routine again tomorrow. I can fail everything--even easy things, a million time--but so long as I keep bouncing back and continuing then that's all that matters!

In other good news, I'm finally half-vaxxed today as well! And my area is fully reopening on July 1st, which I am cautiously optimistic about.
