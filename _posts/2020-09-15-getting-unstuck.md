**Week Twenty-nine!** As @narthur mentioned in another thread, IFTTT is moving to a limit of 3 applets per account. Frankly, I'm surprised it took so long for this to occur, but it does seem disappointingly sudden. I don't think that even IFTTT realizes the consequences of this, however. Automated content on the Internet is _everywhere_, especially lower budget/quality websites. There's going to be a lot of defunct meme pages, that's all I know for sure.

Thankfully I only use 3 IFTTT apps on my Beeminder, and it's good incentive for me to just learn and use direct APIs from now on.

I haven't written anything related to COVID-19 for awhile (rather, since it became a global pandemic), but I wrote a small article on how to [get unstuck](https://notebook.casa/getting-unstuck), as I feel like there's a zeitgeist of being stuck right now. But that might just be me. Though, I recognize that I'm in a place of privilege which is why it's been so easy for me. Being such an introvert, things haven't changed much for me, although I will gripe about how _cheesy_ virtual networking/meetup events feel, is that just me?

Also, deadline epiphany! Last week, I spoke about how only midnight deadlines worked for me. But I had an idea to hack my way out of that. Creating a schedule and routine via _dynamic deadlines_. For instance, having a smaller writing deadline in the morning to complete my daily Morning Pages, or having a step-goal deadline in the afternoon to go on a walk each day.

It's still a little difficult to wrap my head around the fact that, if I'm savvy and clever enough, anything can be Beeminded, including meta stuff like Beeminder burn-out. I'll start experimenting with this idea with new systems this week. (Although you'll just have to take my word for it, since creating a Beeminder to track new Beeminders is one meta too many for me.)
