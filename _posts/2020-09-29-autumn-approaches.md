**Week Thirty-one!** Another rather quiet week. I have to say, autumn is my favorite year, but I always find it more difficult to be productive as the days get shorter and colder. But that seems to be rather universal. More specifically I'm finding it a lot easier to be productive at night than during the day, and I'm not sure why that is.

Ah, I've actually been using 750words since 2011, crazy how time flies! I actually wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@brennanbrown/16-rules-of-journaling-i-ve-learned-after-5-years-2b70dbac4328) on my experience using it since I'm such a big fan. I'd say it definitely needs an update.

Speaking of updates, Fitbit just added "Mindfulness" as a new trackable category, I hope it gets its own API. That would make beeminding meditation a practical possibility for me.

Another thing, I disappointingly realized that Draftin doesn't allow changes to the default deadline of 12am, for whatever reason. (Same with GitMinder, Twitter, and Fitbit) I'm sure if I checked the docs there'd an explanation. That just means that I need to find a different way to track my morning writing, which I'm sure won't be difficult to figure out.

I've been thinking of starting a couple new Beeminders, one for Project Euler since I already have [a repository](https://github.com/brennanbrown/code-challenges) for code challenges. And another for Clozemaster to supplement my French, although I run into the embarrassing issue of not knowing what to name it! (/french2, /clozemaster, /new-french?)

P.S. Anybody having issues with IFTTT recently? It didn't update /jobs at all yesterday and I was getting 500 errors. I had to enter dummy data to avoid derailing but it seems to have sorted itself out today.
