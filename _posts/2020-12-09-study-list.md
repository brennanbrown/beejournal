**Week Forty-one!** It's been a bit of a difficult and introspective week for me. The cold weather and diminishing hours of the winter day are taking a bit of a toll on my morale and productivity. I've made a point to wake up around sunrise, and take a morning walk each day. You'd think that by now I'd get used to Canadian winters after living here... for my entire life, but alas.

Perhaps as an auto-didactic by nature, I've decided to [compile a **list**](https://brennanbrown.medium.com/online-education-for-2021-96af1bf2faf8) of available certification that's either free or relatively inexpensive. And subsequently, I've created a new system called [**/learning**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/learning], which will use RescueTime to track the time I'm learning, using a custom subcategory to make sure it only counts specific websites. I also realize I really need to step **/productivty** in general, probably to five hours per day.

Right now, I'm studying [Product Management](https://www.udacity.com/course/product-manager-nanodegree--nd036) on Udacity! The reason being that I think it's important that I try to bridge my technical skills with my soft skills and content creation. 

I'm probably going to use a [Notion template](https://www.notion.so/Bachelor-of-Arts-in-Organization-Fall-2020-02272d62ab204e88817b5ab3f332617f) for keeping track going forward. I'm looking forward to their API coming out in a few months! I admittedly am still trying to figure out my workflow. 

I have to say, it's very informative and rewarding to have this journal as a way to better understand my progress and journey in retrospect. I'm excited to look at all the specific metrics in detail when I hit the one-year mark in a couple of months.

In other good news, after much trial and error, my [**/weight**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/weight) is finally starting to go down at a reasonable pace. Like with everything else, there wasn't any sort of silver bullet, rather just consistently being active and logging my food intake. As well as [taking my own advice!](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/help-with-eating-slower/7440/2)
