**Week Nineteen!** I'm relieved to finally be finished with the React.js portion of the curriculum that I'm studying, and moving onto Python. I find the language to be a lot less hair-pullingly frustrating than JavaScript is. I've also finally had the time to go through a serious mind dump session and figure out what I want to be doing outside of the systems I already have in place. 

An issue I have is trying to do things that I don't have explicit Beeminders set for. I think it'd be a good idea to jot down all my thoughts and ideas and maybe try to figure out a way to Beemind them? Or, *gasp*, just actually do them regardless. I think.

Mostly, I want to somehow find a better balance between my technical work and my creative work. Hopefully I'll be able to find a few publications to submit my work to, and have some more time to write. There's this concept from the *Do Work Journal* from Baronfig I've been looking into, which is the dead-simple idea of: 

* Starting with your Quarter Milestones (or as Grey would put it, Seasonal Themes).
* Having monthly goals that are directly related to getting progress done towards those milestones.
* And then, having weekly tasks that are directly related to getting progress done on those goals.

### Systems Updates

* **/photos**, I've noticed, will not update in time for the midnight deadline if I post late at night. I'm not exactly sure why this is. Since my other IFTTT work fine with last-minute updates, I'm guessing this has something to do with how Instagram deals with their API.
* **/writing** is also a little finicky, Draft doesn't count words that are directly pasted instead of typed, although I could see this being a feature instead of a bug, it just means that I have to do practically all of my primary writing within Draft, or hack my way around it.
* **/french** is going great! I've moved up to the Sapphire League. Duolingo's competitive-based approach to learning motivates me a lot. I originally started with just 10XP/day but usually do at least 40XP daily.
* **/fitness** is getting a harsh auto-trimming of the saftey buffer, as I should be doing 10,000 steps a day, minimum, to keep healthy. 
* **/distraction** is one of a couple of systems that I've zoomed in on (starting on my restart date this year instead of its inception in 2017), and I've noticed that having an auto-trim on a do-less goal makes it [look rather interesting](https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction)!
