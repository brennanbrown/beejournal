**Week Twenty!** I started this experiment back in February, meaning that I've been my own accountability guinea pig for just over half a year now. Of course, I feel as though I've barely chipped away at my bad habits and negative traits, there is still progress I'd like to review. 

Specifically, the idea of **zero days**, which is an idea that came from [this Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1q96b5/i_just_dont_care_about_myself/cdah4af?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) that gained a lot of popularity within self-improvement communities. 

*TL;DR:* The idea behind it is similar to James Clear's idea of atomic habits, where it's better to do *one* push-up in a day, than nothing at all. With the hope that, once the person is in the position to do a push-up, they'll instead do five or ten. 

As action begets more action the way inaction begets more inaction. Don't let a single day go by where you don't do *anything at all* that would better yourself.

Before jumping into this, there were many zero days where I felt strung-out. Now such a day would cause me a lot of money and derailments. Instead with Beeminder, I find myself having *bare-minimum days* instead. On days that I feel totally unproductive, here's a qualitative list of what I have to do in order to not derail:

* Meditate on what I'm grateful for.
* Write ~500 words in a journal entry or some other medium.
* Take an hour to study programming and work on assignments.
* Take an hour-long walk outside to reach my step goal.
* Read a couple chapters of the book I'm currently on.
* Study French for around twenty minutes.
* Write a summary of the day's events.

That might seem like a silly humblebrag, but it's more of a prelude to a cautionary message I'd like to share. In spite of all the self-help articles that list these kind of things as being important to start doing, and all the aspiring people looking to better themselves with this kinda stuff, I have to say that it doesn't really change how I feel at the end of the day. 

There is no buzzing sense of joy or euphoria when consistently practicing good habits--no deserved dopamine hit[^1]. There is no balanced or equal reaction that you might get from indulging a bad habit, for instance. 

I suppose I continue doing these things is because I feel as though I *ought* to, and I know there's a vague building foundation towards larger works down the line. I know it's a personal fault for not having something more concrete in the long-term future I could be telling myself I'm working towards, however.

That all said, I look forward to continuing this, and to keep adding new ideas and systems to keep pushing myself!
