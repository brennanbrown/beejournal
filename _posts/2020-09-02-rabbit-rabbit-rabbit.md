**Week Twenty-seven!** Rabbit rabbit rabbit! A little late, but I was in the process of a hectic moving and didn't derail on any other goals, so I'm giving myself a break on that. (I also don't have internet utilities set up yet either, thank goodness for personal hotspots!)

The good news is that I'm going to have a *lot* more time to work now, so I'm going to be readjusting my current work schedule and flow-of-things. I believe I'm at a point where I need to formalize my tasks with something like Todoist, and huzzah, that's easily integrated as a Beeminder system itself.

Speaking of, one solution to the constant-reminder problem I was writing about last week would be to reinstate a **/meta** system, but have it explicitly set to have a data point added once there are no other Beemergencies. Might only be a good idea on paper, though.

It might be symbolic, but I really feel like I've been given carte blanche to start doing different self-experiments now. There's still a lot of setup that I need to do, but I look forward to trying new things that I've been putting off. Cold showers is a good example (once I figure out how to switch to the shower nozzle, hah!), and perhaps a stricter wake-up schedule. It's all really up in the air for now.

Also, one fortune side-effect of a system, **/fitness**, has been going on wayward walks around my community and noticing things I would never otherwise if I was just going from point A to point B. I'm looking forward to doing that in a brand new neighbourhood!
