**Week Thirty!** For the first time in a long while, I feel as though I have too many plates that I'm trying to simultaneously spin. I had a weird experience this week, where I didn't realize I derailed until the next day. I was perfectly sure that I *did* everything, and the usual alarms just completely went over my head. 

A tool like Beeminder is really meant to do a bit of alchemy, in regards to work: You expend time and energy using it in exchange for being capable of *other* time and energy on different, trackable tasks. I say alchemy because it does seem paradoxical, or even a ridiculous business model:

> I'm too lazy/busy to do certain work, so I'm going to *different* work on Beeminder.

Perhaps it'd be more sensible to view these tools as [simple machines](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/toolsmachines.html) for cognitive function and ability. It's not really extra work, but rather something you utilize to change the point of which you're applying the work *to*. A lever, or a pulley, or a wedge.

I am rather busy myself, too. I just got my [freelance profile](https://www.upwork.com/o/profiles/users/~015006e0afbe1f3a6d/) approved, while also working on [Marketing certification](https://www.ama.org/content-marketing-certification/), looking for stable employment, and studying data science on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).

That's why I haven't started any new systems yet, even though I said I would by now! Luckily I can create them now, hah.

## New Systems

* [**/morningpages:**](https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages) Could be a considered a sub-system for **/writing**, that's 100 words/day, except the deadline is 11am instead of midnight. Meant to get me to plan out my day. Might transfer to Todoist at some point. (Hopefully automatically trim safety buffer will make this work.)
* [**/jobs:**](https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/jobs) Idea taken from [this thread](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/finding-a-job-with-beeminder/7247/13) from user @mtrazzi. Tracking the jobs that I apply for. Instead of manual data, I caved-in and decided to get IFTTT Pro to get data from Google Sheets so I could provide more detail for each job easily.
