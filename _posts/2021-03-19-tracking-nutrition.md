**Week Fifty-four!** Another standard week. For starters, I created [**/nutrition**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/nutrition) and archived **/foodlog**. I stopped using Noom after my free-trial, as it didn't really provide much value. (except for having a "coach" hold you accountable, I might create another thread looking for an accountability buddy for help keeping myself on track with a new project.)

Besides, FitBit's meal-logging is way better, which is what I'm using on my new system. Since the calorie count actually takes calories-out into consideration, as well as macro and *actual* nutrient breakdown. They also gave me another 3-month premium trial, so I'm looking at my heart-rate variability and breathing rate.

Also, I've been grinding like crazy on Duolingo (as you can see on my [**/french**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french) graph) and finally reached the Diamond league last week and got first place in it! Only took me a year. 

And the only reason I did it was to get the achievements for it. I guess gamification really works on me! That's why I used 750words so much until I ran out of badges to achieve. Who knows, maybe I'll even try Habitica again, but there's so much overlap with what I already do with Beeminder that I don't really see the point. 

And in failure news, I finally derailed myself on **/journalbar** because I missed a week a month ago, better late than never! I also restarted **/weight-check** since I was doing so badly on it before, but I got a new scale and now I'm logging daily!

That's about it for this week. Oh, also fun fact: I ran `cat * | wc -w` in the `_posts` folder on journalkim, and it turns out that I've written 33,000 words so far in this Beejournal, which is around the length of half a novel! Is that worryingly fanatical? Probably.
