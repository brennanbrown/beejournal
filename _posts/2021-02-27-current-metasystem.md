**Week Fifty-one!** I'm recovering from a minor surgery and just settling in. Overall, things are going good. I'm finally diving into [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) which I wish I had done sooner! It's similar to Jekyll, but a lot more powerful and flexible, and although relatively niche right now, I see a bright future ahead. I'm planning to migrate my Jekyll projects to it.

Anyways, back to Bees, it's been since entry [**#25**](https://journal.kim/jam-gardens) that I went over all of my systems entirely! And since this is entry #51, perhaps I'll make it a bi-annual sort of thing. (Would data points be too sparse to make that a feasible Beeminder? Hah!)

I apologize for the following redundancy, however I felt it was a good idea to just have a single, cohesive reference that I can add to or modify easily. Each system has a explanation, as well as an update on how progress is going:

(Additional apologies for going a little emoji-crazy, but once I start I really can't stop.)

## The Metasystem 2021: Review

**🧭 LEGEND:**
- 🟢 Denotes Beeminder goals that are *going really well*, and are at a point where I enjoy doing them or do them automatically.
- 🟡 Denotes Beeminder goals that I'm *having difficulty with*, but still manage to get done when needed.
- 🔴 Denotes Beeminder goals that I'm either *often derailing on*, or putting off altogether due to friction somewhere.
- 📝 Denotes Beeminder goals that are *outcome-oriented*, meaning they track finished, tangible products in some manner.
- 🔁 Denotes Beeminder goals that are *systems-oriented*, meaning they track daily habits that contribute to outcomes, but can be done endlessly.
- 🎈 Denotes Beeminder goals that are *miscellaneous* or meta in nature, or just for fun.

### ✏️ Writing 

- **[🟢🔁 Writing](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/writing)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of words that I write digitally, with a current rate of 450 words/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Draftin](https://www.beeminder.com/draft).\
    **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in June 2020, I've written over 160,000 words(!). I was intimated to start doing it sooner, but it was a habit that I quickly started to enjoy. Most of this is just private journal entries, but also counting blog posts, poems, and this Bee Journal!
  - **[🟡📝 Blog](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/blog)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of [blog posts](https://blog.brennanbrown.ca/) that I write, with a current rate of 1 post/week. Data added via IFTTT and Medium.\
    **_Current Progress:_** I've written a bunch of more blog posts since I started tracking this again last year, around two dozen that I'm proud of! Recently, though, I've been deleting  posts that I've been writing because I feel as though they haven't been up to snuff, so I'm going to be lowering the rate to 2/month.
  - **[🟢📝 Journalbar](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/journalbar)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of posts that I add to [*Journal.Kim*](https://journal.kim) with a rate of 1 entry/week. Data added manually.\
    **_Current Progress:_** I'm often late in writing these updates, but I still manage to get out on per week, and it's really enjoyable!
  - **[🔴🔁 Morning Pages](https://beeminder.com/morningpages2)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of words that I write in a Google Doc, with a deadline of 11am instead of midnight like all of my other goals, and a rate of 250 words/day. Data added via [URLMinder](https://www.beeminder.com/urlminder).\
    **_Current Progress:_** Currently archived, I still haven't started this one! I'm going to push myself to just get it started this week.
  - **[🟡📝 Poetry](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/poetry)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of [poems](https://warsawmountain.com) that I post, with a rate of 1 poem/week. Data added via IFTTT and Tumblr.\
    **_Current Progress:_** I've written around 50 new poems since I started tracking this again! I'm currently in a bit of a creative slump though, but it'll pass.
- **[🟡📝 Twitter](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/twitter)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of tweets that I post, with a rate of 1 tweet/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Twitter](https://www.beeminder.com/twitter).\
  **_Current Progress:_** I've been using this on a private Twitter for a personal diary of sorts, but since I've been using Draft for that more extensively, I want to transition to actually using a public Twitter.

### 📈 Productivity

- **[🟢🔁 Productive Time](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/productivity)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of productive time that I spend on the computer, with a rate of 6 hrs/day. Data added via first-party integration with [RescueTime](https://www.beeminder.com/rescuetime).\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking again last year, I've worked roughly 1,200 productive hours(!). Similar to Beeminder, just having the graphs and data for my usage motivates me a lot.
  - **[🟢🔁 GitHub](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/github)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of commits that I push to GitHub, with a rate of 1 commit/day. Data added via [GitMinder](https://www.beeminder.com/gitminder).\
    **_Progress:_** Since I began tracking last year, I've pushed over 700 commits(!) and create a few open-source projects that I'm really proud of. I *could* track my time coding using WakaTime as well, but this seems to be a good metric.
  - **[🟡📝 Courses](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/courses)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of courses that I complete on [Linkedin Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/), with a rate of 2 courses/month. Data added manually.\
    **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking, I've completed dozens of courses! But I do need to work on learning retention and meaningfulness, since I can breeze by materials too quickly sometimes.
  - **[🟡🔁 Learning](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/learning)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of time that I spend on specific websites and software to encourage my learning in the above courses, with a rate of 1 hr/day. Data added via RescueTime with custom categories.\
    **_Current Progress:_** I've restarted this goal a bunch because like I said, I don't spend enough time on materials, but I've been getting better at it the past few months!
- **[🟡🔁 Distracting Time](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distraction)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of unproductive time that I spend on the computer, with a limit of 2 hrs/day. Data added via first-party integration with [RescueTime](https://www.beeminder.com/rescuetime).\
  **_Current Progress:_** I only have clocked around 300 hours of distracting time this year, but I do derail on this more than most other goals, so I need to be more mindful of how I spend my time on the computer.


### 💪 Physical Health 

- **[🟢🔁 Daily Activity](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/fitness)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount that I walk, with a rate of 5000 steps/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Fitbit](https://www.beeminder.com/fitbit).\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking last year, I've walked over 2.5 million steps(!), though I recently cut the rate by half because I wasn't walking as much with the cold weather, but since it's getting warm again, I'm raising it again soon!
- **[🟢🔁 Sleeping](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/sleep)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount that I sleep, with a rate of 7.21 hrs/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Fitbit](https://www.beeminder.com/fitbit).\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking last year, I've slept over 2,500 hours, which is double the amount of productive time I've accomplished, yikes. At least I've been rather consistent with the amount I sleep.
- **[🟢🎈 Weight](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/weight)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount that I weigh, with a rate of -2.43 lbs./month. Data added via first-party integration with [Fitbit](https://www.beeminder.com/fitbit).\
  **_Current Progress:_** My scale broke, (though not because of me, I swear!), but I'm down around 15 lbs. since I began tracking in October.
  - **[🔴🎈 Weight-check](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/weight-check)**\
    **_Metrics:_** Meta, tracking the amount of times that I add my weight data to FitBit and Beeminder, with a rate of 1 data-point/day. Data added manually.\
    **_Current Progress:_** I was really consistent for several months, and I hope to start again when I get a new scale, whoops!
- **[🟢🔁 Foodlog](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/foodlog)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the meals that I eat, with a rate of 1 data-point/day. Data added manually.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Although rather superficial, I find it is helpful to just write down what I eat, even without nutritional or caloric data, and have found myself eating more healthy over the year!

### 🧠 Mental Health

- **[🟢🔁 Gratitude](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/gratitude)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking what I'm grateful for, with a rate of 1 data-point/day. Data added manually.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking last year, I've written about hundreds of things I've been grateful for! I should probably increase this to 3 things a day, though.
- **[🟢🔁 Meditation](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meditation)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of time that I meditate, with a rate of 8 minutes/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Apple Health](https://help.beeminder.com/article/61-apple-health) and the [Insight Timer](https://insighttimer.com/) app.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in October, I've meditated over 18 hours, and it's definitely helped stabilize and increase my mood. I need to take the time I meditate more seriously, though.
  - **[🟢🔁 Prayer](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/prayer)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of times that I perform the Rosary, with a rate of 1 prayer/day. Data added via [Electronic Rosary](https://blog.beeminder.com/rosary/).\
    **_Current Progress:_** Similar to meditation, I've enjoyed beginning doing this practice, but need to isolate more time to devote towards it.

## 😎 Lifestyle

- **[🟢🔁 Duolingo](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/french)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of XP that I gain in Duolingo, with a rate of 20XP/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Duolingo](https://www.beeminder.com/duolingo).\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking last year, I've gained over 12,000 XP and have a 280-day streak! It's a fun habit that helps me transition into focus, productive work.
  - **[🟢🔁 Clozemaster](https://beeminder/brennanbrown/clozemaster)**:\
    **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of points that I gain in Clozemaster, with a rate of 150 points/day. Data added via first-party integration with [Clozemaster](https://www.beeminder.com/clozemaster).\
    **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in October, I've gained 25,000 points and have a 140-day streak! I find it helps me learn French better than Duolingo at this point.
- **[🔴📝 Photos](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/photos)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of photos that I post, with a rate of 1 post/day. Data added via IFTTT and Instagram.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in July, I've posted over 200 photos. Although I'm also in a creative slump with this rate now, and need to find *what* I want to photograph.
- **[🟡📝 Books](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/books)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of books that I read, with a rate of 3 books/month. Data added manually.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in June, I've read almost 30 books, or rather, listened to. I really need to get into the habit of sitting down and actually reading, instead of just having audiobooks so I can multi-task.
- **[🟢🔁 Jobs](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/jobs)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Tracking the amount of jobs that I apply for, with a rate of 3 applications/day. Data added via IFTTT and Google Sheets.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in September, I've applied to almost 500 jobs, which sounds a little crazy. I know that I need to start tracking more meaningful data points, like call-backs, interviews, etc.

### 🤷 Meta / Misc.

- **[🟢🎈 Derail](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/derail)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Meta, tracking the amount of times that I have to e-mail about a non-legit derail, with a current rate of 0, meaning that I will derail if this happens no matter what.\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in November, I've only had to use this once so far, yay!
- **[🔴🎈 Meta](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/meta)**:\
  **_Metrics:_** Meta, tracking the amount of data-points that are added to all of my other goals, rather it's manual or automatic, with a rate of 25 data-points/day. Data added via [Beemind.me](https://beemind.me/)\
  **_Current Progress:_** Since I began tracking in August, I've added nearly 9,000 data-points in Beeminder! Sadly, the API seems to have stopped working, so I'm going to have to archive. (It was silly and pointless, anyways.)
