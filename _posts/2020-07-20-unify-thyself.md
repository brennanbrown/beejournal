**Week Twenty-one!** I always had this thought that being more mindful of my time, and being intentional would lead to a sense of time going by slower--since you're taking everything in and [thinking slowly](https://medium.com/@marklooi/summary-of-kahnemans-thinking-fast-and-slow-3d1c2ea0e6a). But time is going by for me just as quickly as ever--I can't believe July is almost over! Of course, maybe it's just because it's good weather, as the cold Canadian winters always feel like they're at a snail-pace, no matter how much I'm procrastinating.

This week has been rather uneventful, I feel. I'm currently in the Ruby league on Duolingo with a 60-day streak, and I feel like I'm actually beginning to learn French for the first time. Of course, I need to actually apply ways of immersion and application far beyond linguistic and grammar studying.

I also had a small emergency early in the week, and was surprised to see only two of my systems having non-legit derailments because of that. A good sign that I actually am beginning to know what I'm doing. Speaking more on that, the past few months feel like a trial run--showing to myself (and others) that I'm capable of consistent, routine work. Instead of constantly restarting, I have a bit of a foundation now, which is good! But it is just foundation. 

I require of myself more concise guidelines for my future: 1-year-plan, 5-year-plan, 10-year-plan, etc. These have a lot more gravity to them than just a daily system. I'm reminded of a quote from E. L. Doctorow:

>  “Writing is like driving at night in the fog. You can only see as far as your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.”

I wish life was like that, and I suppose a *sort* of life is, but I feel like long-term vision is mandatory when creating momentum for yourself. I've noticed it's almost universal that success is a compound phenomenon--wherein the longer you work at a singular objective, the more exponentially it grows. But that requires both intelligence and wisdom, because there are also conversely those that work on something for a really long time and don't really have anything to show for it--perhaps because of the sunk cost fallacy.

Anyways, that all being said, I have plans to centralize all the small projects I'm working on (warsaw mountain, journal kim, wander notebook, etc.) in an attempt to unify my work and have something that could actually make an income for myself. I'm really looking for communities (digitally, mostly) of similar-minded people to try to expand my plans, but that's been rather difficult. I don't even know where to start with that.
