**Week Forty-four!** Happy New Year! Alright, one last update before the year ends. I've been at this experiment for around ten months now, and though I'm eager to give a complete summary of how things have gone in February, most people enjoy taking time to reflect at the end of the year, so I'll do a little bit of that now, too.

In spite of everything else, Beeminder has made this year the most productive year I've ever had. Investing my time and really dedicating myself to this has paid off in tenfold. I really can't put into words how grateful I am for the team and the community surrounding it. 

Of course, it's not all perfect! I still feel like I could have accomplished a lot more, put higher rates on certain goals, not flub or derail as much as I have, etc. But all in all, I'm in an upward trend in general, and I'm really happy about that. 

For fun, I've decided to list out some goals I have for the new year, some are attached to already existing Beeminder systems, and some are not--some I have no idea how to make a Beeminder for!
