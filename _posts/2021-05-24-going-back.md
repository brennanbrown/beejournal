**Week Sixty-three!** I suppose it's time to announce some news that I've been sitting on for awhile, now. After a lot of thought over the year, the pandemic has made me re-evaluate a lot, as I'm sure it has with many. And so I've decided to go back to school, and have recently been accepted into the university of my choice for Fall 2021 intake.

I'm rather excited, but also nervous going back as a mature student, now. In order to help myself prepare, I've bumped up a few systems. With **/writing** going from 450 words/day to 2,000, and a few more daily hours for **/learning**. 

I expect to use Beeminder in different ways as a full-time academic student, and hopefully my journal can help me with the transition. I'm not sure what I'll be adding (or removing) yet, but I'm very optimistic Beeminder will help me *a lot* with my education. :D

Of course, there were also quite a few derailments this week. First, **/nutrition** derailed simply because I've been forgetful about logging my meals, and not adding anything does cause an automatic derail. There's more friction than there was when I was just recording with **/foodlog**, but I think the benefits outweigh it.

I also derailed on **/morning-pages2**, but on purpose. I'm finally archiving the goal, and actually starting the real morning pages goal with a starting deadline of 1pm to help me ease into it. I *always* feel more inspired and productive after I've started writing, but of course I put it off as long as possible. :P

And, I nearly derail on **/sleep** almost every night, I'm barely getting my minimum of 7.3 hours. Though, I don't know if I'm actually just needing less sleep, or if my schedule is really terrible. I do feel sluggish with brain fog, etc. but I can think of a number of things that would be the cause of that.
