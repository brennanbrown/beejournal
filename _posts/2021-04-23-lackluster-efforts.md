**Week Fifty-nine!** Not really an entry this week, I'm afraid. I haven't really been productive at all due to health reasons and have been feeling overall pretty demotivated. But I'm at the tail end of it and should be alright for next week. I really need to focus on addressing root causes and not symptoms. 

It's sometimes easy for me to forget what this is about: keeping myself accountable for my Beeminder goals. I get distracted easily with other things that are on my mind (and it's a lot easier to just write whatever in these casual updates as opposed to an actual blog post or something).

And it's also difficult at times to figure out what to exactly update on because things are largely the same. I'm happy with where my goals are and can do them all pretty well, it takes a lot of thought to figure out what to add next.

That being said, I think what I'm going to work on starting is a new beeminder goal for a specific repository (as opposed to **/github** which logs everything) where I'll be housing my new website project. 

As I've written about before, I'm attempting to create a place that I can put all of my stuff (coding projects, writing) while also being a place for daily journaling/microblogging. It's not a technical issue, but rather a UI/design language one, which probably doesn't make much sense.

Anyways, one good thing that I have done is *create separate "productive" accounts* on websites that are usually distracting for me (YouTube, Reddit, etc.) where I only consume helpful/educational material and let the magic of the algorithm continue to only provide me that sorta content. But, I do still need a separate "normal" account or else I'd end up being weasel-y and then the magic algo would no longer work as well!
