**Week Sixty-five!** I haven't written in quite a while, and there are a few reasons for that. Trying to increase certain goals quickly has totally thrown off my momentum with everything. I've been so busy trying to keep up with the bare minimum that a lot has gone neglected. 

This is great though that it's on-topic with what I said in my last post, and with what @dreev's replied with:

> ...somewhere in between is the optimum â€“ where the value of what you get done minus the cost in derailments is maximized.

My biggest pratfall is my inability to find this balance, I think. Either I'm coasting or I'm overwhelming myself, the Goldilocks zone seems to always be on the other side. 

Of course, the simple answer is to just slowly increase your rates on things that you're doing easily. I made the mistake of thinking I could just leap amounts because I've been doing this for so long, now.

Going over the derailments I've had in the past two weeks because of this, **/writing** and **/distraction** for not being able to keep myself focused for long enough. As well as finally derailing on **/sleep**, though I've finally been able to start going to bed earlier and for longer. I also have plateaued on my **/weight** long enough for that to derail as well, but I think that's a good reset.

Also derailing on **/journalbar** since I missed an entry last week, duh.

It's easy to feel lousy and let yourself become complacent with how things are, but as long as you shake yourself out of it and get back on your horse (the sooner the better), then it isn't really a big deal. A couple weeks of inactivity can feel like a lot if you're just going by day-by-day, but it's relatively small when looking over sixteen months and counting. I'm just going to reset my rates for everything for the time being then work my way back up.

I will have to admit though that one of the reasons I've been procrastinating writing this update is because I'm feeling a little burned out on the meta-Beeminding in general, the newest iteration of content around the forums has made it feel rather irrelevant.
