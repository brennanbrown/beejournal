**Week Twenty-two!** As someone who's inherently anti-authoritarian, it's weird to be happy about how the status quo and how its been going. I don't really have much to say in the way of updates, since everything is working as intended. 

For instance, it's nice to see that [my writing](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/writing) has gone from sporadic large entries to consistent small ones instead. Similarly, I stepped up to the Emerald league on Duolingo in just a week. I've been thinking of adding a Clozemaster system as a supplement. 

Also, a new system that I've introduced in the past few weeks is **[/foodlog](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown)**, which is a simple manual text-entry where I enter what I've eaten the day with the syntax: `Breakfast: X + Y // Lunch: Z + A // Dinner: B + C + D`, etc. I figure that just the act of recording my dietary intake will help improve it.

I'm also trying to look for a community. Without having the ability to attend networking events (safely, at least) it's a little puzzling still. The internet offers so much in means of opportunities, platforms, weird niche subcultures, etc. But where do you go if you're trying to find people that wanna actually commit to doing meaningful work and have fun doing it? 

I particularly want to find or start FOSS projects, now that I'm essentially a week from finishing my web development program. I'm not sure if it's imposter syndrome or whatever, but I don't really feel prepared to take on the landscape of the tech sector. I definitely feel like I learned a lot, but at the same time the more I learn, the more I realize I don't know anything at all.

More related, I'm really curious about Beeminder's metrics. For instance, how the average user (or poweruser) makes use of Beeminder. I wonder if I'm "doing it right" or if I'm being too lax. I wrote about burnout in another thread, and I wonder if my fear of it is causing me to not push myself or work as hard as I'm really capable of. Although one thing that I'm sure these Bee journal entries are too long and self-indulgent, haha.

Oh, and next week's entry is going to be a few days late, since I'm actually scheduling a vacation for once.

(PS. Totally unrelated to Beeminder: I **love** GitHub's new [profile README](https://github.com/brennanbrown/) feature.)
