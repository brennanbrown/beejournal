**Week Fifty-eight!** I've been largely working on the redesign of my personal website this week--and as I quoted Carl Sagan in [entry #24](https://journal.kim/apple-pie), to make anything from scratch, you must first invent the universe. Which as been a little overwhelming for me. But I have finally begun to find my footing in the work.

I just have a bunch of little things and projects that are scattered across the Internet that I want to consolidate and unify in a pleasing manner that's also speedy and accessible--which also parallels my non-digital life pretty well, too. I did set up a [little site](https://brennanbrown.github.io) to show off all the open-source coding work I've been doing for the past year. :) 

Anyways, specifically looking at Beeminder, I think I need to figure out a way to automate the tracking of **/journalbar**, because having it be a manual entry means I let myself write this past the deadlines at times. (Like right now, by three hours). 

In all honesty, I don't really consider it that grave of a sin, since it's a weekly event and a few hours late is an insignificant amount of time relative to that. But I'm also acutely aware of how dangerous of a slippery slope that line of thinking is. Maybe I can figure out something with [Integromat](https://www.integromat.com/en) or the newer Zapier clone and confusingly-similarly named, [Integrately](https://integrately.com/store/beeminder). (Which someone should try out, by the way.)

While we're on the meta, I've thought about making this project a newsletter, though I'm not sure if that'd be helpful. I really want to start a newsletter of some kind but I just don't feel as though I have anything of import that could go out on a weekly basis. That might just be imposter syndrome, though.

Also, I think I have to look into adding more to **/fitness** or perhaps create a new system entirely. I've been having pain in my leg after sitting for extended periods (which is very much not good for you at all), and I haven't really been able to find a solid solution for this--maybe a standing desk, though those are expensive.
