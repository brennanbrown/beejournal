**Week Twelve!** Or rather, thirteen? I apologize for the confusing chronology, that's a self-embedded punishment of slacking off.

I've realized I have difficulty with self-permission. The paradox of choice makes it nearly impossible to really understand what I truly want to do in life, let alone how to act on it. 

When I was younger, it felt easy to blog about whatever I wanted, whenever. But the older I get, the more heavy the weight of responsibility feels. In spite of my age, I have no expertise or authority--no formal education. I find it increasingly difficult to attempt an effective discussion. Perhaps that's a reason why I began this venture--as a way to write often without feeling the pressure of my writing needing to be *original* or *impactful*, since I'm just providing mundane updates regarding my personal progress.

To be honest, taking a brief glance at my current list of Beeminders makes me feel overwhelmed. It feels as though there are so many prerequisites, like I already have a tangled and complex mess on my plate. The truth is that I don't, and in fact I have a lot of free time on my hands that I'm wasting.

The truth is that I am in a very privileged position where I have the opportunity to do nearly whatever I want, which really just adds pressure and guilt. 

While I think it's a toxic idea to compare yourself to others, I can't help but to compare myself to where I *ought* to be by now. I'm in my mid-20's now and don't feel like I have anything much to show for it. I've had dreams and goals since I was a kid, and they've become smaller and more humble as I've grown older--which is kind of sad.

An important quote from the stoic Seneca comes to mind: **"These actions are not essentially difficult; it is we ourselves that are soft and flabby."**


## New Systems

* [**/writing:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/writing) I already have three beeminders related to my writing, but they're regarding finished products. I'm gonna try using [Draft](https://draftin.com/) to start to help make me more *consistent* in when I write, as well as having all my writing in one place.
* [**/books:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/books) I spoke before about being concerned about my lack of book reading, and realized I should beemind it! I just finished the heartbreaking memoir *Beautiful Boy* by David Sheff, and am currently on *Stillness is Key* by Ryan Holiday.
* [**/distractions:**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/distractions) I completely forgot that I still had this goal archived, whoops. It uses RescueTime to ensure that I waste as little amount of time in front of my computer as possible.
