**Week Forty-seven!** I'd said I'm doing better this week, productivity-wise. I'm upgrading to a new workstation tomorrow, so that's pretty exciting. 

In regards to Beeminder, I've been trying out small approaches to small new habits. For the past while, I've been using [**/morning-pages2**](https://www.beeminder.com/brennanbrown/morning-pages2) as a way to get into the habit of opening a Google Doc and just write gibberish! 

The idea I've had is to get up in the morning and doing the act of [morning pages](https://juliacameronlive.com/basic-tools/morning-pages/), but my Monkeyweasel mind still doesn't wanna, so I'm taking the approach of getting the simple mechanical act of the habit ingrained, and then doing the writing part.

It's pretty funny, since I have so many other habits that I can do with relative ease, I'm not sure if it's just something particular about this, or if I've reached a sort of willpower limit, if you will. 

On a similar note, I've had this bottle of multi-vitamins that I seldom take more than once a week, even though I ought to take it daily. I find micro-managing this sort of thing with Beeminder unhelpful, since it'd just be a manual entry goal that I could easily weasel. 

However, I bought an additional cod-oil vitamin D supplement (due to the lack of sun in Canadian winter), and I've started taking both daily. It might sound silly, but I think this is because the vitamin D tablet is much smaller, and thus less intimating to try to take! 

Also, since being cognizant of derails, I've been doing them a lot. ðŸ˜… Unlike previously, I haven't ratchet'd my mercy-week of buffer following it, which takes a bit of pressure off, but also results in an ugly plateau in the graphs. Of course, as any seasoned Beeminder user will tell you, the aesthetics of the graphs are the biggest selling point.
