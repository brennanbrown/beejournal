**Week Fifty!** Of course, late again. Although this time it was only partly my fault, as I had a minor medical emergency and a rather surprise moving out. I've been diligently keeping up with my Beeminders, though! Only one derailment, **/photos**. And also a non-legit derail on **/distraction**, sadly adding my first datapoint to **/derail**.

But overall, I'm feeling really good and I'm excited to start doing more good work. [**Journal.Kim/**](https://journal.kim) is now online with a bit of a new look! If you're curious, here's [a pic](https://duck-project.herokuapp.com/artwork/jb.jpg) of how it looked around last year! It is really great to have a little blog that you can maintain independently, and it's helped teach me a lot of things about going forth with bigger projects.

I also did the much-needed housekeeping of updating datapoints to everything! Usually, when I add data for **/books** or **/courses**, I just add the digit without adding the note of what specifically reading or learning. It's kind of satisfying to go back and review each different thing all at once. I also added an auto-ratchet to **/meditation** to help keep me more consistent with it, since I've been getting good at doing it consistently.

It's crazy to think that when I [initially started](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/brennans-beeminder-journal/6340/1) this journal a year ago, I only had five goals. As of right now, I have twenty-six(!), though a handful are meta/supporting systems.

Overall, my systems/goals are relatively stable. I feel like my initial goal of trying to implement Beeminder systems that encompass all areas of life to ensure a balanced and content existence is a modest success so far. 

I do have plans for a few changes and updates in the near future, like getting an Android tablet so I could use RescueTime to specifically track my reading time. (One caveat of the Apple mobile ecosystem is that RescueTime can't track specific things.) As well as reflecting on my relationship with social media and trying to find ways to use it productively and use it to my advantage--easier said than done.
