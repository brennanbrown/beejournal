**Week Fifty-five!** Another quiet and usual week, though I did have a bit of another health flare-up on Friday that sort of messed up my rhythm. I've decided to put a large majority of my goals to "weekends off" to help pace myself and be more mindful about dedicating time to *good work* versus *good play*, and not muck about with an unhelpful in-between that's neither productive or helps me relax.

The only beeminders that I didn't set to have weekends off were ones tied to apps that keep track of streaks themselves (my meditation app, Duolingo, etc.) because the activities are usually short and that makes "not breaking the chain" awfully motivating. I can't say the same for timely, difficult tasks though.

I also think that it was a good idea for me to start with doing things 7 days a week (perhaps at a smaller rate) than taking weekends off from the start. I think it makes a good amount of difference in the act of creating habitual behavior if the task is done daily.

I also derailed on **/nutrition** on Wednesday, when I went on a hike where I walked 30,000 steps, since I needed to obviously eat a lot more. I then recreated the goal with net calories instead of just caloric intake, and that's been working a lot better. 

(To be honest, I'm not sure why net calorie tracking is labelled for "Beeminder experts only!" since it's really the only logical way to track calories at all. Your intake is always going to fluctuate based on your output.)

There's not really much else to report this week. Although I will say that [this article on willpower](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/towards-a-bayesian-theory-of-willpower) that Star Slate Codex wrote that @dreevs posted in the Discord is a super fascinating read! I'm trying to figure out how to apply the idea to my own behavior, and maybe even try to see it's accuracy?
