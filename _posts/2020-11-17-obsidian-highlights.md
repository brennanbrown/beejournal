**Week Thirty-eight!** Not a very eventful week. I've been getting really interested in a program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a "a powerful knowledge base that works on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files." 

The really cool thing is that static site generators like Jekyll also only require plain-text Markdown, so I'm looking to combine the two in [my project](https://github.com/brennanbrown/enjoyment-work).

But anyways, enough about that, let's get into the bees! I had a bad derailment with **/distraction** this week because my little brother started streaming (and got affiliated already!) 

But I set an alarm on my phone to go off at 11:45pm to specifically remind me to check the RescueTime dashboard until it becomes a habit (again), and make sure everything is okay for the day, and one earlier in the day to make sure I'm on the right track.

I had a weird glitch a couple days ago with Draft and **/writing** where it wouldn't update the word counter no matter what I added or how many times I refreshed the Beeminder goal. It was around 11:00pm. The next day, it jumped up to 1,500 words for the *following* day. No idea why, exactly.

I've decided to make my public daily journal anonymous, since I'm still pretty self-conscious to share that much. ðŸ˜… But it'll still help me with my daily goals (and maybe I'll finally start **/morning_pages** correctly now!)

Also, I posted an update for [all my systems](https://forum.beeminder.com/t/show-off-your-goals-and-how-youre-beeminding-them/7465/4?u=brennanbrown) in another thread, you should add your own favourite Beeminder goals!
