**Week Thirty-nine!** I've been rather busy this week with a variety of things, specifically adopting a ten-year-old Tuxedo cat by the name Oreo! It also looks like a second lockdown is (finally) occurring locally, so I'll be spending more time in front of a computer screen, most likely.

I had a derailment on **/writing** a few days ago, I was at around 330 words out of 350 on Draft, just a few minutes before midnight and didn't make it through the threshold. 

As I've talked about before, it might seem tempting to call a 20 word deficit causing a derail to be non-legit, but you should have the mindset that whatever your Beeminding is the bare minimum, and that you *should* be aiming to going above-and-beyond them. That's why the auto-ratchet is a necessity, at least all in my opinion. 

There's been a lot of fruitful and interesting discussion on the Beeminder discord this week, too! Along the same topic, the idea of *paying for non-legit derails*. @lanthala gave me the fantastic idea of starting a new Beeminder goal, [**/derail**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/derail). 

It's a do-less goal that will derail when anything other than `0` is input for the day, or when there isn't any input at all, thanks to Pessimistic Presumptive Reports. So it also doubles as a nice "check-in" goal because of that.

Completely unrelated, but I've began using [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) to better collect and organize content I find on the interwebs. As well as [YiNote](http://www.yinote.co/) for note-taking on videos and [Airr](https://www.airr.io/) for podcasts. 

It's really great to finally get more organized and intentional with my media consumption, but there's no nifty automatic way to use these kind of tools with Beeminder, sadly. Though I could be wrong and I just need to lurk around more.
