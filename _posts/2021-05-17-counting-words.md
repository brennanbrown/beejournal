**Week Sixty-two!** Quite a few Beeminder-related things to talk about this week. First off, my failures: I derailed on both **/distraction** and **/meditation** a few days ago, which definitely was causation. Overall, I've been feeling distracted and disorganized.

I've had to adjust the deadlines for a couple of my OG goals that I started in 2017, since they're starting to reach their default end after almost four years, which is wild. This caused a weird issue with **/productivity** which I think is fixed now.

Speaking of weird issues, **/tweets** says it can no longer track my Twitter account because I have my tweets protected, which is odd because the account has been protected this entire time and has been working just fine. However I'm fine with this, since I've been wanting to transition to a public Twitter account for awhile now. (I think I've figured out how to use it healthily--if that even is possible)

Also, a new system! I haven't added one for a long time, now. So, [**/obsidian**](https://beeminder.com/brennanbrown/obsidian) is going to track my word count in the app I've talked about before in my journal called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) using this [cool plug-in](https://github.com/kenzan100/beeminder-obsidian-word-count) by [kenzan100](https://github.com/kenzan100).

I know that I still need to start using Google Docs as well for my **/morning-pages** goal which I still have on the backburner. As well as set up the script so I can start tracking my chess playing as well. So many things to dooooo. 

Also, totally unrelated, but This American Life's episode this week was all about [daily routines and rituals](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/737/the-daily). One quote that stuck out to me was that "some days the ritual doesn't matter much, some days it's full of meaning. The important part is that it's done everyday"--echoing the Bojack Horseman quote on top of my [Bee Journal website](https://journal.kim).
