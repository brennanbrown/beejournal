**Week Eighteen!** I wrote a [post on productivity](https://notebook.casa/one-year-rule) already this week, so I feel as though this is gonna be a little short. 

* **/collection** is going to be deleted, as I'm not really using it at all. I thought it'd be an interesting idea to try to collect interesting things as Beeminder data points, but it seems like using a dedicated program, such as Notion, would be more sensible. 
* **/spending** also needs to be deleted, or at least restarted, as it's become a bit of a headache to retroactively go through my purchases. The easiest solution would be to *stop spending*, of course.
* **/writing** needs changes to the automatic saftey buffer, since I've been getting into the habit of doing *a lot* of writing in a day then doing none for a few days after. Although this is far better than nothing, I'd much rather have the consistency of doing a small amount daily.

I recieved input from user ZedMango in the Beeminder forum regarding my issue with manual input systems. Their solution was to add a secondary metasystem that would check the factuality of the previously set data, and if it was incorrect, to correct it and properly derail instead of continuing the bad habit of weaseling out of it.

And I'm glad I thought about it for awhile before responding. Because in reality, that wasn't the issue at all, as I originally thought it was.

Initially, I thought the reason I prefer automatic data input vs. manual was because of mere laziness. The reality is though, I enjoy them because they are *precise*, as required by such a mechanical process. 

In other words, I think I just wasn't being specific enough with something like **/bulletjournal**, since there's a lot or a little that you can do within that method of journal writing. I believe I need to implement the SMART criteria when creating a new system, particularly being specific with manual goals.
